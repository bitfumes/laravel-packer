With the above command it will create package scaffoldig for you.

Optional fields like 'vendor', 'author' and 'author_email' can also be given via command line interface if you are not willing to provide on command.

## Same as Artisan commands

With this CLI, you will have access to all artisan commands you are familier on Laravel.

You can create controller just like you do with `php artisan`

```bash
packr make:controller controller_name
```

![make](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41295276/46673800-38cbac00-cbf8-11e8-9a1b-c02e91da8563.gif)

Explore all commands, just run `packr` on your command line.

_Now you can create Migrations and Factories also_

## Smart Clone

With `packr clone` command you can do 3 steps in just one.

```bash
packr clone {repositoryname}
```

This not only clone repository but also install composer and if that repository type is project, then it will generate key for project also.

#### Specify directory to clone

Just like git, you can clone repository to any directory, just give `--dir=` option for above command

```bash
packr clone {repositoryname} --dir={custom_directory_name}
```

#### Specify branch to clone

Just like git, you can clone any branch of given repository.

```bash
packr clone {repositoryname} --branch={branch_name}
```

## CRUD Generator

With `packr crud` command you can create crud for laravel appication with fully green tests

### step 1

First we need to create a json structure for our migration of any model/table
To do so run this command

```bash
packr crud:json {exactModelName}
```

### step 2

Now you have json file, you can describe how your migration/schema is going to look.
After giving all details you can now run command to actually create full crud for the model

```bash
packr crud:make {relativePathOfThatJsonFile}
```

Above command will create various files like

- Model with relationships
- Controller with all crud functions
- Routes based on web or api file
- factory
- migration
- unit test (if relationship is decribed in json)
- Feature test for all crud part

This not only clone repository but also install composer and if that repository type is project, then it will generate key for project also.
