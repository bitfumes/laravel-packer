Laravel Packer was created by, and is maintained by [Sarthak Shrivastava](https://github.com/bitfumes), and it is a Command Line Tool which is going to help you in creating package.

-   Built on with [Laravel-zero](http://laravel-zero.com).

## Installation

Install via composer.

```bash
composer global require bitfumes/laravel-packer --prefer-dist
```

## Creating new Package Scaffolding

With the above command it will create package scaffoldig for you.

Optional fields like 'vendor', 'author' and 'author_email' can also be given via command line interface if you are not willing to provide on command.

## Same as Artisan commands

With this CLI, you will have access to all artisan commands you are familier on Laravel.

You can create controller just like you do with `php artisan`

```bash
packer make:controller controller_name
```

![make](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41295276/46673800-38cbac00-cbf8-11e8-9a1b-c02e91da8563.gif)

Explore all commands, just run `packer` on your command line.

_Now you can create Migrations and Factories also_

## Smart Clone

With `packer clone` command you can do 3 steps in just one.

```bash
packer clone {repositoryname}
```

This not only clone repository but also install composer and if that repository type is project, then it will generate key for project also.

#### Specify directory to clone

Just like git, you can clone repository to any directory, just give `--dir=` option for above command

```bash
packer clone {repositoryname} --dir={custom_directory_name}
```

#### Specify branch to clone

Just like git, you can clone any branch of given repository.

```bash
packer clone {repositoryname} --branch={branch_name}
```
